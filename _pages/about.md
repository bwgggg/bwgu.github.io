Welcome to my page
==================

Welcome! I am an academic working at the intersection of wireless communications and low-power Internet of Things (IoT). On this page you can find a brief introduction to my background, research interests, and recent activities.

About Me
========

I joined the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://it.xju.edu.cn/info/1150/3289.htm), Xinjiang University, as an Associate Professor in August 2024.

I received my Ph.D. degree from Macau University of Science and Technology in 2024, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/eedongli). I obtained my M.S. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2021, during which I worked with [Prof. Yongjun Xu](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/xuyj/zh_CN/index.htm), and earned my B.S. degree from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2018.

My research focuses on designing low-power, intelligent wireless systems for future IoT networks, with an emphasis on backscatter communication, reconfigurable surfaces, and edge intelligence.

Research Interests
==================

- Backscatter communications and ambient IoT
- Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) / intelligent reflecting surface
- Mobile edge computing and wireless-powered MEC
- Semantic and goal-oriented communication for IoT
